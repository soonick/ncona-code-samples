# Using gcloud-sdk To Work With Storage Buckets In Rust

To run this example, you will need the json key for a Google Cloud service account with cloud storage admin permissions. Save the key, with the name `key.json` in the same folder as this README file.

You will also need to set the constant `PROJECT_ID` inside `src/main.rs` to your google cloud project id.

To run the code:

```
make run
```
