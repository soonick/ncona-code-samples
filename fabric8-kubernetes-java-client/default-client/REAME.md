# Fabric8 Kubernetes Java Client

To run the sample in this folder you will need to have a Kubernetes cluster available and a valid configuration for this cluster under `~/.kube/config`. If you don't have a cluster, you can start one easily using [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

To run the sample that lists all pods:

```
bazel run :demo
```
